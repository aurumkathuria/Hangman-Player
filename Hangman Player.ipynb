    "1) Up to Cell 3 is everything to guess a word given its length, the 10,000 word list, and the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) After Cell 3 is my attempt at using a algorithm to try and maximize word-guessing accuracy. I did a lot of work to try and figure out how best to approach the problem, which can be seen in Cells 4, 7, and 8. I then tried to implement that solution, which can be found in Cells 5 and 6. However, as detailed in the write-up for this project on my GitHub (bit.ly/Hangman-Player), that whole thing was wrong and based on very faulty assumptions. I'd still like to think the code and conceptualization behind the idea is cool, but I need some different data in order to really make use of this at all. Til that day comes though, feel free to mess around with this and see what you can do!  "
